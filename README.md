This repository consists of the different Python scripts that I used during my undergraduate thesis entitled: 

# Analyzing the Climate Characteristics of Temperature and Rainfall and How it Shapes the Climate Zones of Eastern Visayas using ERA5 Dataset

These different scripts are here to serve as future reference for future codes. I do not claim to be a professional in said field, however,
I hope these scripts can represent my intellect in coding and interpreting said results.

DISCLAIMER: I do not claim to be fluent in coding especially in machine learning (unsupervised via K-means clustering) as I am still venturing 
into this vast field.


# general-scripts

This directory consists of the other general scripts that I used in my study that produced different visualization maps such as DEM maps, PAR extent, etc.
